Project description :
What’s the issue?
Tourism is growing fast, and while that’s great for local economies, it can harm nature, pollute places, and even damage heritage sites if not handled well. Many tourists want to travel responsibly, but they often don’t have the right tools or information to make eco-friendly choices.

Why this matters:
We need to protect our environment and culture while still letting people enjoy travel. The goal is to find a balance between fun and responsibility — helping travelers learn, explore, and make better decisions that don’t hurt the planet.

Our solution:
We’ve built an easy-to-use web app called Sustainable Tourism Explorer to help travelers do just that!

This app lets you:

📊 Explore how many tourists visit different states and when.

🌿 Discover beautiful eco-tourism spots that need extra care.

🏛️ Learn about important heritage sites worth visiting — and protecting.

🏢 Read up on what the government is doing to promote green tourism.

💡 Get helpful tips on how to travel in a way that’s kind to the planet.

🎫 Check out ticket prices for different places.

🎯 Test your knowledge with a fun Eco Quiz that picks random questions each time you play.

🤖 Ask our friendly chatbot anything about eco-tourism and get instant answers.

What’s the benefit?
This app helps travelers become more aware of their impact and gives them everything they need to plan smart, sustainable trips. It’s also a fun and interactive way for students, tourists, and even officials to learn more about eco-friendly travel.
